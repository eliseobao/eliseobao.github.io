I am a final year Master's student in Computer Science who works at the [Information Retrieval Laboratory (IRLab)](https://www.dc.fi.udc.es/ir/) of the [University of A Coruña](https://www.udc.es/en). My main research interest is Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in the areas of mental health and underrepresented linguistic groups. I am currently focused on the incredible progress in Large Language Models (LLMs).
