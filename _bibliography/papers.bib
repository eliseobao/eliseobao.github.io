    title={Ranking of Reddit users using Relevance Models for depressive disorders},
    abstract={Depressive disorders are one of the most common groups of illnesses in the world. Although it is true that effective treatments exist, either due to the lack of resources or the stigma that is still associated, in many cases the consequences for those suffering from this type of disorders are devastating. Knowing that the language manifested by people suffering from this type of diseases can denote evidence of their mental health, the aim of this project is to exploit the possibilities of Relevance-Based Language Models to be used for early detection. Specifically, taking CLEF eRisk collections as a starting point, the goal is to build depression vocabularies. These vocabularies identify terms of weight and relevance in people with depressive tendencies, and must undergo phases of evaluation and comparison with other validated lexicons. In addition, we focus in being able to perform ranking, i.e., from texts written by a number of people, to establish a ranking for them according to the possible degree of depression. For the management of the project, an agile methodology has been used, so that it has been possible to adapt the project according to the results obtained in the experimentation. Satisfactory results have been achieved, especially in terms of ranking, as well as new avenues for experimentation and expansion have been set.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
