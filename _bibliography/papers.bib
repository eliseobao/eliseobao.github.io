	abstract     = {Depressive disorders are one of the most common groups of illnesses in the world. Although it is true that effective treatments exist, either due to the lack of resources or the stigma that is still associated, in many cases the consequences for those suffering from this type of disorders are devastating. Knowing that the language manifested by people suffering from this type of diseases can denote evidence of their mental health, the aim of this project is to exploit the possibilities of Relevance-Based Language Models to be used for early detection. Specifically, taking CLEF eRisk collections as a starting point, the goal is to build depression vocabularies. These vocabularies identify terms of weight and relevance in people with depressive tendencies, and must undergo phases of evaluation and comparison with other validated lexicons. In addition, we focus in being able to perform ranking, i.e., from texts written by a number of people, to establish a ranking for them according to the possible degree of depression. For the management of the project, an agile methodology has been used, so that it has been possible to adapt the project according to the results obtained in the experimentation. Satisfactory results have been achieved, especially in terms of ranking, as well as new avenues for experimentation and expansion have been set.},
